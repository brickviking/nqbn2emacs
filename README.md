# nqbn2emacs - Not Quite Brand New to Emacs

#### Hints and aids for when you just want to know some stuff.

This is a condensing of some of the information available from Vim help and Emacs info documents;
other information came from the irc://freenode#emacs channel. And when you just want to chill out,
I've added some of the soundtracks I've come across. There's even some programming tips for
plenty of other computer languages. Other information (in one instance) came from the emacs wiki:

### But I'm brand new!

You're brand new. So was I, once. Now I'm not quite so brand new, but there's still a lot I don't
know about. I haven't really explored exotic topics such as Tramp, gnus/mu4e, or the whole Elisp
ecosystem that Emacs lives on.
