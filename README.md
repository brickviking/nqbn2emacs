# nqbn2emacs - Not Quite Brand New to Emacs
#### (or perhaps vim)

#### Hints and aids for when you just want to know some stuff.

The notes.org file is a condensing of some of the information available from Vim help and Emacs info documents;
other information came from the irc://freenode#emacs channel. And when you just want to chill out,
I've added some of the soundtracks I've come across. There's even some programming tips for
plenty of other computer languages. Other information (in one instance) came from [the emacs wiki](https://emacswiki.org/).

### But I'm brand new!

You're brand new. So was I, once. Now I'm not quite so brand new, but there's still a lot I don't
know about. I haven't really explored exotic topics such as Tramp, gnus/mu4e, or the whole Elisp
ecosystem that Emacs lives on. I also don't address emacs variants such as spacemacs or Doom Emacs.

### Okay. I've got this file, but it's got lots of ***, +, - | and + all over the place

That's probably because you should download this file, and open it up with some version of emacs, preferably one later
than 23.4.1 but even that will do at a pinch. If you don't have emacs and you're using vim, then there's a plugin version
of org mode for vim. It won't be as complete as the org-mode in emacs, as (to the best of my knowledge) the vim plugin
doesn't do tangling but it should get you a long way.

It's even viewable in any text editor that's not emacs or vim, but you miss all the benefits of collapsing (folding) headings
and of course, most of the Emacs and Vim instructions are relevant only to these two editors specifically.
