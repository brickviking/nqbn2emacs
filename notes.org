Brand new to Emacs? Here's some hints and aids for when you just want to know some stuff. Addresses Emacs and Vim.
#+END_abstract

* Introduction
       :PROPERTIES:
       :UNNUMBERED: notoc
       :END:
I was brand new to Emacs, once. Now I'm not quite so brand new, but there's still a lot I don't
know about. The notes.org file is a condensing of some of the information available from Vim
help and Emacs info documents; other information came from the [[irc://freenode#emacs][Freenode #emacs channel]], which
requires an IRC client to connect to. Other information (in one instance) came from [[https://emacswiki.org/][the emacs wiki]].

There's even some programming tips for plenty of other computer languages. 
And if you just want to chill out, I've added some of the soundtracks I've come across. 

** Disclaimer
I haven't really explored exotic topics such as Tramp, gnus/mu4e, or the whole Elisp
ecosystem that Emacs lives on. I also don't address Emacs variants such as XEmacs, spacemacs or
Doom Emacs.

This document was created in a development version of emacs (at this date, 28.0.50); as such it may
have some items in here that haven't turned up in earlier versions of Emacs. I also don't discuss
the differences between Emacs text mode and graphical mode much, as most of the things you can do
in Emacs don't /require/ the graphical client except for details of the fringe. I've also used a
reasonably recent version of vim (8.1) but not as up-to-date as Emacs.

* Emacs
** What different keys mean
Throughout this documentation, and indeed most Emacs documents that I've read, key prefixes are abbreviated
according to the following list. This was basically cribbed from the following document in the manual:
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Modifier-Keys.html][Listing of modifier keys]]

If a key is shown as <F2> that means to hit the =F2= keyboard at the top of the keyboard, not the two keys F and 2.
<Tab> means the =Tab= key on the left hand side, not the three characters T, a and b. <RET> is simply the Return
key, or =Enter= on most modern keyboards.

This means that instead of having to type the words Control-Meta-V, Emacs will do what you want
as long as you hold down the =Control= and =Alt= keys and then tap the =V= key (and let everything go).
In the minibuffer (the blank section right at the bottom of the Emacs program), the keystrokes will show
up in their abbreviated form.

In addition, all letters are usually shown in their lowercase form, even though most keyboards show the
uppercase letters on their keycaps.

*** Key: =C-=
 + Long name: Control
 + Alternatives: Ctl-/Ctrl
 + Notes: Both usable, and generally mean the same thing
*** Key: =S-=
 + Long name: Shift
 + Alternative: Sh-
 + Note: Both shift keys usable
*** Key: =M-=
 + Long name: Meta
 + Alternative: Alt
 + Note: Left alt differs from right alt, which is often AltGr on non-US keyboards
*** Key: =Esc=
 + Long name: Escape
 + Note: Can be used in place of Alt, but you hit this and then let it go before using the next key
*** Key: =<RET>=
  + Long name: Return
  + Alternatives: Enter/Ent
  + Note: In emacs docs, shown as RET
** Rare modifier keys
These keys aren't used very often, and in the case of Super and Hyper, aren't used at all in default Emacs.
If you don't have the modifier keys (or you haven't already bound them to existing keys on your keyboard),
you can enter each using =C-x @= followed by one of =a=, =h= or =s=.

=C-x @ h= adds the Hyper flag to the next character, =C-x @ s= adds the Super flag, and =C-x @ a= adds 
the Alt flag. 

*** Key: =A-=
  + Long name: Alt
  + Note: This key on the keyboard actually issues =Meta= keystroke, not an Emacs =Alt= keystroke.
    As a result, there aren't many Emacs keybindings that use Alt-something, and most commands use Meta-something.

*** Key: =s-=
  + Long name: Super
  + Alternative: Windows
  + Note: Often used by the operating system especially on Windows
*** Key: =H-=
  + Long name: Hyper
  + Alternative: No modern equivalent
  + Note: Sometimes bound to Fn or Menu
** And the mouse buttons:
   |-----+---------------------+----------------------------------|
   | Key | Long name           | Notes                            |
   |-----+---------------------+----------------------------------|
   | LMB | Left Mouse Button   |                                  |
   | RMB | Right Mouse Button  |                                  |
   | MMB | Middle Mouse Button | Often Scrollwheel on modern mice |
   |-----+---------------------+----------------------------------|

** Movement keys
Vim has them. Most modern editors have Up/Down/Left/Right and C-right/left, but emacs and vim both have far richer ways of moving the
cursor around a text file, by either a character (or multiple characters at once), a word or a line. In the table
below, Left/Right refer to keys on the keyboard, not mouse buttons. Buttons will be indicated as RMB/LMB. Lines look like this:

=Key= - =what-it-will-do= 
 + Description of the Emacs command that the key will trigger.
 + Alternate binding: =other-key=
*** =Right= - =right-char=
  + Moves the cursor to the right of its previous position on the line.
*** =Left= - =left-char=
  + Moves the cursor to the left of its previous position on the line.
*** =Down= - =next-line=                                                                   
  + Steps to the next line and the same character position, if possible, otherwise it will step
    to the last character on that line.
  + Alternate binding: =C-n=
*** =Up= - =previous-line=
  + Steps to the previous line and the same character position, if possible, otherwise it will step
    to the last character on that line.
  + Alternate binding: =C-p=
*** =M-f= - =right-word=
  + Step forward to the next non-alphanumeric character.
  + Alternate binding: =C-<Right>=
*** =M-b= - =left-word=
  + Back to the first alpha-numeric character of the word.
  + Alternate binding: =C-<Left>=
*** =C-a= - =beginning-of-line=
  + Puts the cursor at the left-most position of the current line.
*** =C-e= - =end-of-line=
  + Puts the cursor at the right-most position of the current line, usually the last character even if that is a space.
*** =C-Down= - =forward-paragraph=     
  + Steps the cursor forward to the first character of the next paragraph
*** =C-Up= - =backward-paragraph=
  + Step the cursor backward to the first character of the previous paragraph

** Editing keys
Further reference: [[info:emacs#Basic Undo][info:emacs#Basic Undo]] (info "(emacs) Basic Undo")
These are some of the keys responsible for deleting or copying text to a "kill-ring" to restore later. 
Some of these bindings change behaviour slightly in org mode, the table is aimed mostly at Fundamental mode, though a lot of it is
also relevant for most other modes that aren't org-mode.

*** =C-x u= - =undo=
  + Description: Undoes the last action, whether that was text insertion or deletion.
  + Alternatives: =C-/=, =C-_=
  + Note: can use a numeric prefix =C-u <number> C-x u=, which undoes <number> of actions. Can also undo
only in a region.

*** =C-k= - =kill-line=
  + Description: Removes from point until the end of the current line.
*** =C-u 0 C-k=
  + Description: Removes from point until the beginning of the current line.
*** =Del= - =delete-char=
  + Description: Removes single character.
  + Alternative: =C-d=. 
  + Note: This does not store to the kill-ring.
*** =M-d= - =kill-word=
  + Description: Deletes forward to the beginning of the next word.
*** =M-Del= - =backward-kill-word=
  + Alternative: M-BACKSPACE
  + Note: Kill back to the beginning of the previous word (backward-kill-word).
*** =C-y= - =yank=
  + Description: Copies the most recent entry on the kill-ring into the buffer. After that, =M-y= will restore earlier points on the kill-ring instead of the most recent entry.
** Display of long lines
Reference: (info "(emacs)Continuation Lines")

Emacs will display lines for text files in one of three ways, either line-truncated, with a symbol on the end to
let you know there's more, or line-wrapped, with an arrow in the fringe (or a $ for text terminals) for lines that
continue on the next line. Visual line mode is like line-wrapping, but with the break for the next line happening between
words. This makes these long lines a bit more readable. Visual-line-mode is a minor mode, so it's toggled
with =M-x visual-line-mode=. Ordinary line wrapping is toggled on and off with =M-x toggle-truncate-lines=.

** Cock-ups
   * When starting a remote file access, don't run M-x tramp first. Things will break.
   * A docstring is not info documentation. =C-h f= gives you docstrings, but go to relevant info manual for details.
   * Don't blindly accept local variable exec sections, emacs could break when trying to save or quit.
** Help
*** =C-h C-h=
Metahelp: a front page to other help pages.
*** =C-h C-C= - Copyright notice
Displays the copyright notice for Emacs, in this case, the GNU General Public License version 3.
*** =C-h r=
The front page for the Emacs manual.
*** =C-h i=
The front page for all info documents shown in the infodir.
*** =C-h d=
Info Doc Search: this will request a search term and look through all of the info documents on your system.
*** =C-h m=
Describe current major mode, and shows what keys are bound to Emacs commands. Also shows other minor modes in effect.
*** =C-h b=
Describe binding, mode-sensitive.
*** =C-h c=
Describe key, mode-sensitive.
*** =C-h f=
Describe function.
*** =C-h h=
Hello in multiple languages and scripts, needs good fonts with wide glyph coverage.
** Recommended Plugins
These are plugins I use a lot of the time. They're either already built into Emacs,
or they can be installed from ELPA/MELPA.
*** magit
This isn't native to vanilla emacs, but is a great front end for git commands. Reading the info documents
for this is a really good idea, to make better use of magit.
*** erc
This IRC client comes native with Emacs. It can be quite powerful, although there are alternatives that
I haven't used yet such as ircle.
*** Org mode
One of the most highly recommended things that Emacs offers, there are a lot of things you can do with it,
including literate programming. If you want to avoid the loaded-with-emacs version and go with the
absolutely latest version of org mode, there are instructions at https://orgmode.org

I tend to use it for literate configuration of emacs, as I can "tangle" the source sections into a config
file that emacs can use directly. The non-source sections describe the rest of it. I won't go into
the whole literate programming idea, but it started with Donald Knuth in his seminal work
The Art of Computer Programming.

I describe further things down in the [[#Org_Mode][Org Mode]] section.
*** vterm
Again, this isn't native, but is a more powerful (in some ways) terminal, offering more support for
programs that use the screen like they expect to own it. It isn't perfect, but it's quite good at
what it does. Check the vterm section below for the few hints I have.

On the other hand, these are some plugins that come as a recommendation from someone in
 irc:#emacs@chat.freenode.org, I can't personally vouch for these plugins, I haven't used them myself.

** Windows/Frames
These commands all work with windows and frames. A frame is a collection of one or more buffers, divided
among one or more windows. A window is a "division" of the frame, usually showing the contents of a
buffer.
   |------------------------------------+------------------------|
   | Command                            | Key                    |
   |------------------------------------+------------------------|
   | Cycle through visible windows      | C-x o                  |
   | Focus buffer to whole window       | C-x 1                  |
   | Split window Top/Bottom            | C-x 2                  |
   | Split window Left/Right            | C-x 3                  |
   | Open new file in another window    | C-x 4 f                |
   | Scroll other window                | down C-M-v, up C-M-S-v |
   | Close frame                        | C-x 5 0                |
   | clone-indirect-buffer-other-window | C-x 4 c                |
   |------------------------------------+------------------------|
Note on the clone-indirect-buffer-other-window: this is a way to get a new buffer with its own separate
point and mark. This is useful if you want to show another section of the same file without scrolling
the other buffer in the process.
** Buffers
A buffer holds the contents of a file, whether an on-disk file or a on-the-fly buffer containing a 
command's output, such as the *Messages* buffer, the *Completions* buffer, or the *Help* buffer.
These keys work with open buffers and allow you to change between them or even create new ones.

*** =C-x b= - =switch-to-buffer=
  + Description: Switch to named buffer, creating it if needed.
  + Note: there's no requirement to have a physical disk file providing the contents for the buffer.
*** =C-x C-b= - =list-buffers=
  + Description: Splits the window into two and displays buffer selection window containing a list of open buffers in the newly-created window.
  + Note: q closes the window, other keys are shown in the section about the Buffer Selection window.
*** =C-x 4 b= - =switch-to-buffer-other-window=
  + Description: Swap to buffer in other window, creating a new window (and perhaps buffer) if necessary
*** Buffer selection window
These are keys that are only active when your cursor is in the buffer selection window:
#+CAPTION: Buffer Selection Window keys

   | Command              | Key | Notes                                         |
   |----------------------+-----+-----------------------------------------------|
   | Mark                 | m   | Mark file for future commands                 |
   | Mark for deletion    | k   |                                               |
   | Delete marked        | x   | Asks for confirmation if buffer is not saved  |
   | Undo mark            | u   |                                               |
   | Undo all marks       | U   |                                               |
   | Open in window       | 1   | Removes buffer selection window, opens buffer |
   | Open in other window | o   | Opens buffer in other window beside list      |
   | Quit buffer list     | q   | Closes (quit-window) the buffer list window   |
   |----------------------+-----+-----------------------------------------------|

*** Buffer encoding
Change encoding (GUI) by clicking mouse-1 on colon or encoding in headerline
    |------------+-------------------------------|
    | Modeline   | Encoding                      |
    |------------+-------------------------------|
    | -:@---     | UNIX (LF 0x0A)                |
    | -(DOS)@--- | Dos encoding (CRLF 0x0D 0x0A) |

    |------------+-------------------------------|

** Dired
These are some of the commands that can be used in a dired buffer. For all intents, you can do nearly
everything in here that you could do from a commandline—deletion, moving or renaming. Of course, creation
is done by simply opening a new buffer and saving it to a location that you enter when you type
=C-x s=. You can move using the usual cursor motion commands, either Up/Down/Left/Right or C-n C-p.

With regard to moving by "pages", you can insert the content of subdirectories in each dired buffer with
the command M-x dired-insert-subdir. That content will appear below the content of the top directory, with each
subdirectory that you insert becoming a new page. Use C-x [ and C-x ] to move between those pages.

|-------------------+------+----------------------------------------------------|
| Command           | Keys | Notes                                              |
|-------------------+------+----------------------------------------------------|
| mark for deletion | d    | Once you've marked files, use x to delete them all |
| Delete now        | D    | Will ask for confirmation                          |
| Unmark one/all    | u    |                                                    |
| Mark by extension | *.   | Requests an extension to apply marks with          |
| Kill              | k    | Remove marked files from listing                   |
| Toggle marks      | t    | Invert whatever marks are present                  |
|-------------------+------+----------------------------------------------------|

To remove certain files from the listing (this does not delete them from the disk), mark them first, then
select k. You can also remove file patterns by first selecting by regexp as follows: 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x dired-mark-files-regexp <RET> .*\.xml$ <RET>
#+END_SRC
This marks everything that matches the *.xml pattern. Then hit k to remove the xml files from the listing. 
The same thing can be done (if you wish to remove files with a matching extension) with *. as follows:
=*.xml=

*** Link syntax
Generally, links work well within org mode, and don't quite work so well outside once you
try to export the org document to other formats.  Links look like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
[[URL][Description]]
#+END_SRC
or alternatively simply
#+BEGIN_SRC org
[[URL]]
#+END_SRC
Description (if you provide it) should be short, no more than perhaps five words.
URL is anything supported by the Org internals, this can include:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
+ http links: http://example.com/
+ info links: [[info:org#Top]]
+ internal org-mode links [[magit]]
#+END_SRC

Other link formats are described in Org [[info:org#External links][External links]]
*** inline images
+ Inline images in org mode: toggle visibility with C-c C-x C-v
+ Change size of inline org images
  + Don't forget to eval (setq org-image-actual-width nil)
  + with #+ATTR_ORG: :height ... :width ...
*** Turn region into list:        =C-c -=
*** Turn region into headers:     =C-c *=
*** Oddities
    If you turn on—or you have defined in emacs startup—scroll-lock-mode, cursor movement within a
collapsed org-mode document behaves slightly differently. 
** magit
*** Requirements
First, install and enable magit if you haven't already. These following instructions assume that
you've done so, and will also presume you have a working knowledge of common git commands.
If a file you're editing is in a git repo, then =M-x magit= will open up a second
window beside your file, and will show you some categories related to the repo. A shortcut is =C-x g=.

*** Magit buffer commands
From the magit buffer, you can do the following things. Most of them will prompt for other
things if they need them. Usually you put your cursor on the object you want to affect, or
on the section header (usually indicated by a font of different colour) if you wish to affect
all files in that category.

NB: the section header often has a > in the fringe, but this is not visible in textmode.
**** Adding untracked file:        =s= (=M-x magit-stage-file=)
 Simply put your cursor on the file you want to stage, hit s. The file should then shift into "Staged
 changes", ready for you to commit. This roughly duplicates "git add file.blah".

 TODO: No idea how to add a directory from magit yet.
**** Staging changes in an unstaged file:     =s= (=M-x magit-stage-file=)
 Same as above, except for a file that's already part of the git repository.
**** Committing changes in staged files:      =c= (=M-x magit-commit=)
 Will request how you want to commit, hit =c= again to bring up an editor window. Provide a single line
 commit message. If you want to add more lines, leave a blank line after the single line as follows:
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE diff -n
 Initial commit message

 This is the next line for a multi-line comment.
 # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
 # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
 #
 # On branch master
 # Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
 #
 # Changes to be committed:
 #	modified:   notes.org
 #
 # Untracked files:
 #	notes.org~
 #
 #+END_EXAMPLE
**** Show diff against files:      =d= (diff)

**** Refresh magit buffer:         =g= (magit-refresh)
 This refreshes the magit status buffer once you've made some changes within the project and saved those changes to disk. Installing =magit-filenotify= and enabling =magit-filenotify-mode= in the status window will automate this somewhat.
**** Expand/hide section:          =<TAB>=
 Type TAB to expand or hide the section at point.
**** Visit change/commit:          =<RET>=
 Type RET to visit the change or commit at point.
**** Push changes to remote:       =P u=
This takes any changes you have in your current repo and can push them to a remote repository if you have commit privileges there. I usually like to use =P u= (that's a P followed by a u, not a P-u), but there are other options available.
**** Configure repo variables:     =P C=
This seems to allow you to configure certain things about your current git repository, such as descriptions, further remotes, and some other details.
**** Other movement keys
The usual =n= and =p= keys move the cursor up and down between sections.
*** Wrap up
There's a lot more that I haven't added, perhaps (info "(magit)Top") will help out if you
have magit installed.

** erc
   + quit server: C-c C-x

** EXWM
EXWM is an X window manager, written to use emacs as the controlling window.
[18:51:34]<oni-on-ion> for EXWM, does anyone know how to "unfloat" a window ?
[18:52:18]<oni-on-ion> i am using an external API that throws the window right in the middle of the screen over top of everything =/
[18:53:36]<jamzattack> oni-on-ion: C-c C-t C-f runs the command exwm-floating-toggle-floating

** vterm
Doesn't come as standard with emacs, but is well worth the install. Running other programs inside vterm
can come with a couple of pitfalls though, especially if you're expecting to run vim, which actually
works, by the way. If you want to copy stuff from a vterm buffer, toggle vterm-copy-mode with C-c C-t,
make your selection, copy it to the killring (or is it yank ring?), then toggle vterm-copy-mode back off
again. Toggling it back off allows commands such as M-w to be passed through to the program you're
running inside vterm—for example, the vim editor.
** Snippets from freenode#emacs
*** How to search/replace all * at B.O.L. with the same number of #
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- <laertus> i need some search and replace help...  [19:53]
- <laertus> i'd like to replace all the leading *'s in a buffer with the same number of #'s
- <laertus> so if a line starts with *** i'd like to replace that part of the line with ###
- <laertus> and if it starts with ** i'd like to replace the ** with ## etc
- <laertus> i can write a function to do this, but was hoping there'd be an easier way  [19:54]
- <Viking667> not really sure. I'd have done it in vim with :%s/***/###/cg  [19:55]
- <Viking667> but that's not the emacs way, and that's not taking account of the escaping too.
- <laertus> yeah, that'll only work for exactly 3 ***'s and it can be done exactly that way in evil
- <laertus> i'm looking for a more general solution that'll work for any number of leading *'s
- <dale> laertus: How about: M-x query-replace-regexp RET ^\*+ RET \,(make-string (length (match-string 0)) ?#) RET  [20:08]
- <Qudit314159> It works here  [20:13]
- <Viking667> I'll have to check that on my buffer.
- <laertus> someone gave me a vim solution on #vim:  %s/^\*\+/\=substitute(submatch(0), '*', '#', 'g')  [20:14]
- <laertus> unfortunately, i don't think that'll work with evil, as evil doesn't implement vim's regex engine, and instead just uses emacs' regex engine  [20:15]
- <Qudit314159> Well, dale's should work. If it doesn't, something else is wrong I'd say
- <dale> laertus: Yeah, I tested mine here, it works.  Point was before the text you wanted to replace, right?
- <laertus> it's probably something to do with my emacs config  [20:17]
- <Viking667> and it works fine for me (I'm pretty much vanilla emacs)
- <dale> laertus: I can't think of another way to do it with Emacs regexps.
- <laertus> well, thank you, dale, it's a good solution
- <dale> You... might be able to do it if you had PCRE and a look-behind assertion, but I'm not sure since I can't remember if PCRE does variable-width look-behind.  [20:19]
- <Viking667> i.e. copy query-replace-regexp, paste it into M-x, type in ^\*+, hit RET, copy the last long bit, paste it in etc etc.
- <piyo> in elisp: (query-replace-regexp "^\\*+" '(replace-eval-replacement replace-quote (make-string (length (match-string 0)) 35)) nil nil nil nil nil)  [20:23]
- <piyo> also, works for me if I turn off pcre-mode and on, as well. yeah  [20:25]
- <Viking667> I might snip that and stuff it into my notes.org  [20:26]
- <laertus> piyo: that works for me but it prompts me to confirm every replacement  [20:27]
- <piyo> press ! to confirm all
- <laertus> ah, ok.. thanks  [20:28]
- <piyo> press ? for more info in the query-replace-regexp
- <laertus> this vim solution:  :g/^\*/norm! vt r#  [20:29]
- <piyo> to me, doing that (make-string...) thing in the minibuffer makes me want more guided help.
- <laertus> makes me realize that this could be done with a macro
- <laertus> just search for a * at the beginning of the line, and then replace all *'s until the first space with #'s  [20:30]
- <laertus> and repeat the macro until done
- <piyo> the same thing with tramp, can't remember the incantation. Can't you just transient/dialog box the url for me?

*** How to clean up a referred URL from duckduckgo - jamzattack from #emacs@freenode
Duckduckgo does a very sinful thing -- instead of linking to
=https://url.com=, it links to:
: https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%3A%2F%2Furl.com

Here, I define a function that removes all this junk, and use [[info:elisp#Advising Named Functions][advice]]
to filter the arguments given to [[help:shr-urlify][shr-urlify]].  Because this is
relatively low-level, all occurrences of duckduckgo's redirects that
are parsed with =shr= are replaced with the clean version.

#+name: un-duckduckgo-url
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

*** How to create a second buffer on the same file with a separate point/mark
[11:41:32]<Viking667> Hi all. Wanted to know if I could have a second buffer on a file with its own point/mark? (Normally if I split the window to make two buffers) I notice that if I move the point in the first buffer, that'll be mirrored in the second buffer. That's not quite what I want.

[14:51:49]<grym> Viking667: org-store-link maaaybe
[14:51:52]<Viking667> Ordinarily in a web browser I'd go C-l C-c, and then paste the link from the address.
[14:52:02]<TRS-80> Viking667: yes what grym said
[14:52:29]<TRS-80> I have that command bound globally, because I use it everywhere all the time
[14:52:46]<shoshin> yeah org-store-link works in everything emacs afaik
[14:53:10]<shoshin> iirc i had to use bookmarks for specific places in a pdf tho?
[14:53:17]<TRS-80> pretty much, and you can also write your own custom link types if needed
[14:53:24]<shoshin> then i made a link to the bookmark or something
[14:53:31]<Viking667> Right. how do I retrieve that link?
[14:53:46]<Viking667> (without grubbing through the *Messages* window?
[14:53:48]<shoshin> org-insert-link should have it
[14:54:02]<grym> Viking667: C-c C-l and it'll be in the minibuffer, probably the default selection

*** Resize images dynamically
[16:52:32]<Viking667> Hm. I stumbled across something nice in org-mode, if inline-images are shown and they're all huge, put mouse pointer on one, and go Ctl-Scrollwheel-Down. WAIT between each resize, it can take a while on older computers.
[16:53:09]<Viking667> I'm not sure if it's applicable in other places too. Nice thing about it is that only the image gets resized, not the buffer text.

* Vim
You know, that other editor. The one that emacs users don't like to admit liking. It has a tighter
focus on editing text. That's it. Nothing more. It's not an eco-system like Emacs is, and doesn't
try to be anything else. However, even it has a scripting language underneath, called vimscript.
Because the editor is focussed so tightly on editing text, it has a wide commandset for editing, and
you can do some really compact and powerful commands in just a few keys.

One example I like to quote so often, because I haven't found an equivalent that's any shorter, or
even the same size.

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
ma013yy41j14p`a  (15 characters)
#+END_SRC
This does the following:
| Keys | Description                                              |
|------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| ma   | :mark, using the a letter. :help mark for more details.  |
| 0    | step to column 0, the left hand side of the screen.      |
| 13yy | copy 13 lines to the copy buffer, check :help yank       |
| 41j  | step forward 41 lines                                    |
| 14p  | paste 14 copies of the 13 lines each, giving you a total |
|      | of 182 new lines                                         |
| `a   | Go back to where you were                                |
|------+----------------------------------------------------------|

And that's just one example. It's only 15 characters long, with quite a kick in its tail. And if you
don't find what you want just in vimscript, it even has a plugin system that rocks. I don't tend to
use them, so I don't include much here about it.

I don't describe more detailed vimscript here, basically because I don't know how to use it myself.

As you can tell, many vim commands take an optional numeric argument, either before in the case
of =6yy= or embedded in the command in the case of =y6y=. In this case at least, they both give
you the same result. At least one opinion holds that you should probably prefer the 6yy form, as
it's simply for n times, repeat x item. A special note about the =y<Space>=, means literally hit
the =y= key, followed by the =Spacebar=. You may often see special notes about keys in <> throughout
the Vim help.

** Macro commands
Check :help macro
Key mapping is used to change the meaning of typed keys.  The most common use
is to define a sequence of commands for a function key.  Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC vim
        :map <F2> a<C-R>=strftime("%c")<CR><Esc>
#+END_SRC
This appends the current date and time after the cursor (in <> notation, see :help <> for details).
Picking this apart, you have the command :map. This command takes two (or more) arguments. 
+ First argument is the key to bind, delimited by <>, which you may need to specify. If it's just a straight
  key, such as I, you probably don't need to put that into <>, but you will for things like C-c, F2 and
  anything where the symbol takes more than 1 character to type the whole key definition.
  + NB: you can often hit the key itself after typing :map in which case, vim will turn F2 into <F2>.
  For example, if you want to bind F2 (as in the case above), then you type <F2> as the key.
+ The second argument is what you want to type when you hit F2. In this case, it's generally vim
  commands in command mode. You can bind keys in insert mode, but that comes with a bit more to do.
