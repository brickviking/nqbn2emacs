Brand new to Emacs? Here's some hints and aids for when you just want to know some stuff. Addresses Emacs and Vim, and also provides some other distractions for when you're in need of them.

* Introduction
       :PROPERTIES:
       :UNNUMBERED: notoc
       :END:
I was brand new to Emacs, once. Now I'm not quite so brand new, but there's still a lot I don't
know about. The notes.org file is a condensing of some of the information available from Vim
help and Emacs info documents; other information came from the [[irc://freenode#emacs][Freenode #emacs channel]], which
requires an IRC client to connect to. Other information (in one instance) came from [[https://emacswiki.org/][the emacs wiki]].

There's even some programming tips for plenty of other computer languages. 
And if you just want to chill out, I've added some of the soundtracks I've come across. 

** Disclaimer
I haven't really explored exotic topics such as Tramp, gnus/mu4e, or the whole Elisp
ecosystem that Emacs lives on. I also don't address Emacs variants such as XEmacs, spacemacs or
Doom Emacs.

This document was created in a development version of emacs (at this date, 28.0.50); as such it may
have some items in here that haven't turned up in earlier versions of Emacs. I also don't discuss
the differences between Emacs text mode and graphical mode much, as most of the things you can do
in Emacs don't /require/ the graphical client except for details of the fringe. I've also used a
reasonably recent version of vim (8.1) but not as up-to-date as Emacs.

* Emacs
** What different keys mean
Throughout this documentation, and indeed most Emacs documents that I've read, key prefixes are
abbreviated according to the following list. This was basically cribbed from the following
[[info:Emacs#Modifier Keys][listing of modifier keys]] in the manual.

If a key is shown as <F2> that means to hit the =F2= keyboard at the top of the keyboard, not the two keys F and 2.
<Tab> means the =Tab= key on the left hand side, not the three characters T, a and b. <RET> is simply the =Return=
key, or =Enter= on most modern keyboards. 

This means that instead of having to type the words Control-Meta-V, Emacs will do what you want
as long as you hold down the =Control= and =Alt= keys and then tap the =V= key (and let everything go).
In the minibuffer (the blank section right at the bottom of the Emacs program), the keystrokes will show
up in their abbreviated form.

In addition, all letters (aside from prefixes) are usually shown in their lowercase form, even though most
keyboards show the uppercase letters on their keycaps. In most cases, unless you specify otherwise,
Emacs will assume that the uppercase letters from A..Z are the same as lowercase when combined with any
of the prefix keys.

*** Key: =C-=
 + Long name: Control
 + Alternatives: Ctl-/Ctrl
 + Notes: Both usable, and generally mean the same thing
*** Key: =S-=
 + Long name: Shift
 + Alternative: Sh-
 + Note: Both shift keys usable
*** Key: =M-=
 + Long name: Meta
 + Alternative: Alt
 + Note: Left alt differs from right alt, which is often AltGr on non-US keyboards
*** Key: =Esc=
 + Long name: Escape
 + Note: Can be used in place of Alt, but you hit this and then let it go before using the next key
*** Key: =<RET>=
  + Long name: Return
  + Other long name: =<return>=
  + Alternatives: Enter/Ent
  + Note: In emacs docs, shown as RET. =RET= is the same as =C-m= (or =C-j=).  The actual =<return>= key can only be
    accessed in a graphical environment and is translated to =RET= but can be bound independently. (Thanks to
    Jamie Beardslee for the extra information).
** Rare modifier keys
These keys aren't used very often, and in the case of Super and Hyper, aren't used at all in default Emacs.
If you don't have the modifier keys (or you haven't already bound them to existing keys on your keyboard),
you can enter each using =C-x @= followed by one of =a=, =h= or =s=.

=C-x @ h= adds the Hyper flag to the next character, =C-x @ s= adds the Super flag, and =C-x @ a= adds 
the Alt flag. 

*** Key: =A-=
  + Long name: Alt
  + Note: This key on the keyboard actually issues =Meta= keystroke, not an Emacs =Alt= keystroke.
    As a result, there aren't many Emacs keybindings that use Alt-something, and most commands use
    Meta-something.
*** Key: =s-=
  + Long name: Super
  + Alternative: Windows
  + Note: Often used by the operating system especially on Windows
  + This is not the uppercase S used for Shift keys, but a lowercase s.
*** Key: =H-=
  + Long name: Hyper
  + Alternative: No modern equivalent
  + Note: Sometimes bound to Fn or Menu
** And the mouse buttons:
   |-------+---------------------+----------------------------------|
   | *Key* | *Long name*         | *Notes*                          |
   |-------+---------------------+----------------------------------|
   | LMB   | Left Mouse Button   |                                  |
   | RMB   | Right Mouse Button  |                                  |
   | MMB   | Middle Mouse Button | Often Scrollwheel on modern mice |
   |-------+---------------------+----------------------------------|

** Movement keys
Info link: [[info:emacs#Moving point][Moving point]]

Vim has them. Most modern editors have Up/Down/Left/Right and C-right/left, but emacs and vim both have far richer ways of moving the
cursor around a text file, by either a character (or multiple characters at once), a word or a line. In the table
below, Left/Right refer to keys on the keyboard, not mouse buttons. Buttons will be indicated as RMB/LMB. Lines look like this:

=Key= - =what-it-will-do= 
 + Description of the Emacs command that the key will trigger.
 + Alternate binding: =other-key=
*** =Right= - =right-char=
  + Moves the cursor to the right of its previous position on the line.
*** =Left= - =left-char=
  + Moves the cursor to the left of its previous position on the line.
*** =Down= - =next-line=                                                                   
  + Steps to the next line and the same character position, if possible, otherwise it will step
    to the last character on that line.
  + Alternate binding: =C-n=
*** =Up= - =previous-line=
  + Steps to the previous line and the same character position, if possible, otherwise it will step
    to the last character on that line.
  + Alternate binding: =C-p=
*** =M-f= - =right-word=
  + Step forward to the next non-alphanumeric character.
  + Alternate binding: =C-<Right>=
*** =M-b= - =left-word=
  + Back to the first alpha-numeric character of the word.
  + Alternate binding: =C-<Left>=
*** =C-a= - =beginning-of-line=
  + Puts the cursor at the left-most position of the current line.
*** =C-e= - =end-of-line=
  + Puts the cursor at the right-most position of the current line, usually the last character even if that is a space.
*** =C-Down= - =forward-paragraph=
  + Steps the cursor forward to the first character of the next paragraph
*** =C-Up= - =backward-paragraph=
  + Step the cursor backward to the first character of the previous paragraph
*** =M-g c <num>=  =goto-char=
  + Step the cursor to the offset specified, i.e. =M-g c 2304= moves point to character 2304.
*** =C-Home= - =beginning-of-buffer=
  + Moves the cursor to the beginning of the buffer
  + With optional arg between 0 and 10, (=C-u arg C-Home=) positions cursor arg*10 percent
    from the beginning of the buffer
*** =C-End= - =end-of-buffer=
  + Moves the cursor to the beginning of the buffer
  + With optional arg between 0 and 10, (=C-u arg C-End=) positions cursor arg*10 percent
    from the end of the buffer
** Editing keys
Info link: [[info:emacs#Basic Undo][Basic Undo]]

These are some of the keys responsible for deleting or copying text to a "kill-ring" to restore later. 
Some of these bindings change behaviour slightly in org mode, the table is aimed mostly at Fundamental
mode, though a lot of it is also relevant for most other modes that aren't org-mode.

*** =C-x u= - =undo=
  + Description: Undoes the last action, whether that was text insertion or deletion.
  + Alternatives: =C-/=, =C-_=
  + Note: can use a numeric prefix =C-u <number> C-x u=, which undoes <number> of actions. Can also undo
only in a region.

*** =C-k= - =kill-line=
  + Description: Removes from point until the end of the current line.
*** =C-u 0 C-k=
  + Description: Removes from point until the beginning of the current line.
*** =Del= - =delete-char=
  + Description: Removes single character.
  + Alternative: =C-d=. 
  + Note: This does not store to the kill-ring.
*** =M-d= - =kill-word=
  + Description: Deletes forward to the beginning of the next word.
*** =M-Del= - =backward-kill-word=
  + Alternative: M-BACKSPACE
  + Note: Kill back to the beginning of the previous word (backward-kill-word).
*** =C-y= - =yank=
  + Description: Copies the most recent entry on the kill-ring into the buffer. After that, =M-y= will restore earlier points on the kill-ring instead of the most recent entry.
** Display of long lines
Info link: [[info:emacs#Continuation Lines][Continuation Lines]]

Emacs will display lines for text files in one of three ways, either line-truncated, with a symbol on the end to
let you know there's more, or line-wrapped, with an arrow in the fringe (or a $ for text terminals) for lines that
continue on the next line. Visual line mode is like line-wrapping, but with the break for the next line happening between
words. This makes these long lines a bit more readable. Visual-line-mode is a minor mode, so it's toggled
with =M-x visual-line-mode=. Ordinary line wrapping is toggled on and off with =M-x toggle-truncate-lines=.

** Registers
Registers are slots to store stuff in, whether it's a string, a file position, a rectangle or a
region. This section would benefit from being filled in further, though it's well described in info
documentation (=C-h i=, =m=, =Emacs=, =m=, =Registers=).

*** Storing current file position (=C-x r <SPC> <x>=)
When your "point" or cursor, is at the position you want to remember for later, set the point's
current position into register <x> (alphanumeric single characters, most other keyboard combinations
except for =C-g= and a few others). Your current point position will be stored.

For example, let's say I notice an error on the word "troibles" in the following quote. I'm where
the asterisk is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
To be or not to bi, that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troibles,*
And by opposing end them.
#+END_EXAMPLE

I know there's a mistake up in the first line (to bi), but I want to remember my current position
so I can jump back and fix this error too. So, let's use Register R as our example register, but
any will do. With the point at the comma after "troibles,", put in =C-x r <SPACE> R=, then jump
off to fix the other error up on the top line. To get back, you then put in
=C-x r j R= and your cursor should be back at the end of troibles.

*** Returning to stored position (=C-x r j <x>=)
As stated above, this jumps you back to a previously-stored position in register <x>. Your previous
position before jumping will also be stored, so if you need to get there, you can get back there
with =C-x C-x= (exchange-point-and-mark).

*** Saving (=C-x r s <x>=) and restoring (=C-x r i <x>=) text
The two commands above will respectively store what's in a region (previously defined with 
=C-space= up to and including your point) into or restore from the register <x>.
Restoring text from a register doesn't wipe the register contents, which can be useful if you want
to repeat the insert multiple times. The only time a register's contents will be wiped is if you
insert new content or delete the register.

** Macros
*** Basic commands
Info link: [[info:emacs#Keyboard Macros][Keyboard Macros]]

If you need to store sequences of keyboard commands in particular, you can generally record these in
what's called a keyboard macro. There's a few different ways to start the process off, but generally
the old school way that most long-time emacs users use, is =C-x (= and the modern iteration on this
is =F3=. Once you have your sequence of keys, use =C-x )= to finish, or =F4=. No good keyboard macro
is complete without the ability to invoke that macro. =C-x e= executes all the commands in that
sequence, as will =F4=.

If you want to create another keyboard macro afterwards, just repeat the same steps, with =F3= to
start it off, and =F4= to stop (or the older commands if you're on a really old Emacs version). If
you're wondering whether the originally defined macro goes away, it doesn't, but it goes onto a
Keyboard Macro Ring, just like the yank ring for deleted objects. If you need one of those earlier
macros back, then you can cycle around the "ring" with =C-x C-k C-n= (kmacro-cycle-ring-next) or
=C-x C-k C-p= (kmacro-cycle-ring-previous).

Here's a quick summary so far of the keyboard commands we've used, along with
their respective emacs functions that get called.

|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| *Name*                | *Shortcut*             | *Emacs function*                     |
|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Start macro           | =C-x (=                | kmacro-start-macro                   |
|                       | =F3=                   | kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter |
|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Stop macro            | =C-x )=                | kmacro-end-macro                     |
|                       | =F4=                   | kmacro-end-or-call-macro             |
|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Call (or run) the     | =C-x e=                | kmacro-end-and-call-macro            |
| last-defined macro    |                        |                                      |
|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Step to next macro    | =C-x C-k C-n=          | kmacro-cycle-ring-next               |
|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Step to prior macro   | =C-x C-k C-n=          | kmacro-cycle-ring-prev               |
|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Name macro for later  | =C-x C-k n=            | kmacro-name-last-macro               |
|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Insert keyboard macro | =M-x insert-kbd-macro= | insert-kbd-macro                     |
|-----------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|

If you had looked at the table and wondered why the function names differ between =C-x (= and
=F3=, it's because the Emacs developers overloaded the functions onto the same keystroke, so that
a choice is made at the time of the keystroke, depending on where you are. 

If you're not in a macro-defining session, then =F3= will start recording a macro, just like =C-x (=
does. If, however, you're inside a macro-recording, then =F3= will increment an internal counter,
and insert that counter's value at the point your cursor is. The counter will be explained in a
later section, but doesn't usually get used for the most basic macros, i.e. you only use it if you
need it.

There's also a difference between the =C-x )= and =F4= calls, in that =C-x )= just finishes
recording the macro, if you're inside a macro recording session. If you're not, and you use this,
it'll generally sulk and say "Not defining kbd macro".

*** Naming
Of course, you're going to want your macros to last beyond the current editing session. To do this,
simply save the macro with a name with =C-x C-k n=, and then insert it into your =init.el= or other
suitable file with =M-x insert-kbd-macro=. I generally insert the macros I use into the files I'm
working with so that I can change the macros for each project if they need a little tweaking for
small differences. The last command turns the keyboard commands into their corresponding elisp
functions, and inserts the sequence of commands into the file.

You can now execute this sequence of commands just by going =M-x yourmacroname=, in short if you called the macro hihi, and you do =M-x hihi=, then that sequence of commands will be repeated once you hit =RET=.

Note that you can't actually call this keyboard macro from lisp directly as it's not actually a lisp
function, it's merely a sequence of keystroke commands. You can however call most lisp functions
from within the macro, and I've used it to stitch together footnotes into a text simply by doing
some of the donkey work within the macro as it's the same search each time, but with the text
differing between runs. You can also call this keyboard macro by binding it to an unused key on
your keyboard, but I'll save that for later.

*** Wrinkles
If you're old-school, you'll be aware of this one, but if you're currently in the middle of defining
a macro, you'll notice that =C-x e= will not only finish recording the macro, but will also re-run
that macro just like =F4= does after recording has finished. That's useful in a few circumstances,
but users that are new will probably want to make sure they finish recording the macro without
invoking it again.  Don't be tempted to simply shortcut the process if you don't want that macro
executed as you finish defining the macro.

*** Further discussion points
Items from this list will get gradually shuffled up into the main body of the Macros section as I
learn more about them.

**** Editing existing macros
**** Recursion (recursion (recursion...))
**** Keyboard macro counters
** Cock-ups
These are some of the few things I've found out so far that tend to break without obvious reasons, or
not be obvious to the really new Emacs user.
   * When starting a remote file access, don't run M-x tramp first. Things will break.
   * A docstring is not info documentation. =C-h f= gives you docstrings, but go to relevant info manual
     for details.
   * Don't blindly accept local variable exec sections when loading a file, Emacs could break when 
     trying to save or quit. I once got to the stage where I couldn't close Emacs down legitimately.
** Help
Info link: [[info:emacs#Help][Help]]

What follows is a rough summary of the available help commands. The first is pretty important. More
complete details are available from the info manual.

*** =C-h C-h=
Metahelp: a front page to other help pages.
*** =C-h C-c= - Copyright notice
Displays the copyright notice for Emacs, in this case, the GNU General Public License version 3.
*** =C-h r=
The front page for the Emacs manual in info format.
*** =C-h i=
The front page for all info documents shown in the infodir.
*** =C-h d=
Info Doc Search: this will request a search term and look through all of the info documents on your system.
*** =C-h m=
Describe the current major mode, and shows what keys are currently bound to Emacs commands. This
also shows any other minor modes in effect in your current buffer.
*** =C-h b=
Describe binding, mode-sensitive.
*** =C-h c=
Briefly describe key, mode-sensitive. The output appears in the mini-buffer as one or more lines.
*** =C-h k=
This describes a key in more detail than the above command, and the docstring output appears in a
split buffer usually to the right of your current buffer.
*** =C-h f=
Describe function. Input the name of a function such as =find-file=.
*** =C-h h=
Hello in multiple languages and scripts, needs good fonts with wide glyph coverage.

*** The long way around
If you need help on a whole key sequence you can't normally get from C-h k then evaluate this in emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(describe-key (kbd "C-h"))
#+END_SRC

This will give you help on what function =C-h= calls up. The same is true for most other key sequences that you can type in that form such as "C-g", "M-x" and so on.

** Recommended Plugins
These are plugins I use a lot of the time. They're either already built into Emacs,
or they can be installed from ELPA/MELPA.
*** magit
This isn't native to vanilla emacs, but is a great front end for git commands. Reading the info documents
for this is a really good idea, to make better use of magit.
*** erc
This IRC client comes native with Emacs. It can be quite powerful, although there are alternatives that
I haven't used yet such as ircle.
*** Org mode
One of the most highly recommended things that Emacs offers, there are a lot of things you can do with it,
including literate programming. If you want to avoid the loaded-with-emacs version and go with the
absolutely latest version of org mode, there are instructions at https://orgmode.org

I tend to use it for literate configuration of emacs, as I can "tangle" the source sections into a config
file that emacs can use directly. The non-source sections describe the rest of it. I won't go into
the whole literate programming idea, but it started with Donald Knuth in his seminal work
The Art of Computer Programming.

I describe further things down in the [[#org-mode-1][Org Mode]] section.
*** vterm
Again, this isn't native, but is a more powerful (in some ways) terminal, offering more support for
programs that use the screen like they expect to own it. It isn't perfect, but it's quite good at
what it does. Check the vterm section below for the few hints I have.
** Plugins recommended by others
On the other hand, these are some plugins that come as a recommendation from someone in
irc:#emacs@chat.freenode.org, I can't personally vouch for these plugins, I haven't used them myself.
  + flyspell - expensive on computation
  + wc-mode
  + writegood

** Windows
Info link: [[info:Emacs#Windows][Window commands]]

These commands all work with windows within a frame. A frame is a collection of one or more windows;
each window displays the contents of a buffer.  Not all buffers have to be visible, but are available
to display at any time.

In addition, you can also change the number of windows displayed in your frame, so that the selected
window takes up the entire frame, or to split the frame into multiple divisions, each containing
a window.

   |----------------------------------------+------------------------|
   | *Command*                              | *Key*                  |
   |----------------------------------------+------------------------|
   | Cycle through visible windows          | C-x o                  |
   | Remove focussed window                 | C-x 0                  |
   | Focus buffer to single window in frame | C-x 1                  |
   | Split window Top/Bottom                | C-x 2                  |
   | Split window Left/Right                | C-x 3                  |
   | Open new file in another window        | C-x 4 f                |
   | clone-indirect-buffer-other-window     | C-x 4 c                |
   | Scroll other window                    | down C-M-v, up C-M-S-v |
   |----------------------------------------+------------------------|
Note on the clone-indirect-buffer-other-window: this is a way to get a new buffer with its own
separate point and mark. This is useful if you want to show another section of the same file without
scrolling the other buffer in the process. Changes in the content of the buffer will be duplicated
in any other buffer pointing to that same content.

*** Resizing or deleting windows
Info link: [[info:emacs#Change Window][Changing Windows]]

Just like some other environments (vim being one) you can also change the amount of space the window
takes up on your frame, within certain limitations. If your single window already fills your frame,
then there's not much you can do except to split the window in some fashion. But if you have
multiple windows displayed in your frame, then you're able to resize the window to allocate more or
less space to that window.

   |------------------------------+-------------------|
   | *Command*                    | *Key*             |
   |------------------------------+-------------------|
   | Shrink window                | M-x shrink-window |
   | Shrink window to buffer size | C-x -             |
   | Expand vertically            | C-x ^             |
   | Expand to right              | C-x }             |
   | Expand to left               | C-x {             |
   |                              |                   |
   |------------------------------+-------------------|

A note about about shrinking the window; there is a command to make a window shrink to just the size
of your buffer, if your buffer happens to take up less lines than it's given. This works well for
files that only have four or five short lines in them, but if the buffer is larger than the current
window, then the =C-x -= won't do anything.

** Frames
Info link: [[info:Emacs#Frames][Frame commands]]

These commands all relate to working with frames, as opposed to windows or buffers. As described above,
a frame is what most people would call a "window" in most other contexts. Frames are collections of
buffers organised amongst one or more windows per frame.

Most of these commands rely on a graphical display being present (either of Xorg/Wayland/Aqua/Windows)
as opposed to a purely textual display (as in a terminal emulator).

** Buffers
Info link: [[info:Emacs#Buffers][Buffer commands]]

A buffer holds either:
  + the contents of a file, perhaps an on-disk file,
  + or an on-the-fly buffer perhaps containing a command's output or output from an emacs function.

Examples of the latter include the *Messages* buffer, the *Completions* buffer, or the *Help* buffer.
These keys work with open buffers and allow you to change between them or even create new ones.
They are also great mates with the Window and Frame commands mentioned previously.

*** =C-x b= - =switch-to-buffer=
  + Description: Switch to named buffer, creating it if needed.
  + Note: there's no requirement to have a physical disk file providing the contents for the buffer.
*** =C-x C-b= - =list-buffers=
  + Description: Splits the current window into two and displays the buffer selection window containing a
    list of open buffers in the newly-created window.
    Change to the window (=C-x o=) to work with the entries in the buffer-selection window.
  + Note: q closes the window, other keys are shown in the Buffer Selection section.
*** =C-x 4 b= - =switch-to-buffer-other-window=
  + Description: Swap to buffer in other window, creating a new window (and perhaps buffer) if necessary
*** Buffer selection window
These are keys that are only active when your cursor is in the buffer selection window:

** Input
Info link: [[info:emacs#Selecting Input Methods][Selecting input methods]]

*** Changing input language character set.
    Sometimes you have to change what language you input characters with, even if you only have a US keyboard and layout.
Emacs supports input of multiple character sets, to change between them, use =C-x RET C-\=, which will then prompt you for an input method.
Hitting =Tab= at this point will supply you with a list of everything that Emacs knows how to input. You will of course
also need font support to display any of the characters you wish to input. A good Unicode font will help here. For normal use
(inputting English or other latin-based text), a lot of people tend to use TeX input. You can also get a list of supported
inputs with =M-x list-input-methods=.

Examples of input include chinese-py (Simplified Chinese using pinyin), japanese-hiragana (hiragana using romaji), and greek
(Greek characters). There are many more variants as well.
** Paragraphs
Paragraphs are sections of text, usually separated from each other by either a blank line, or
terminated by a period. The default width for paragraphs is a hangover from the dim dark times when
output used to be on printer paper, and most printers would only print a maximum of 80 normal
characters (or 96 squashed ones) on a sheet of A4 paper before running out of room and having to
drop down to the next line. Letter sized paper was a little different, but was prevalent in America.

These days, most monitors are far wider than that, even though smartphone screens aren't.
Additionally, we've had proportional fonts for a very long time now, and that can't easily be
counted the same way as a fixed-width font, as each character from i to m can be significantly
different from each other. But as Emacs dates from the very late 'seventies and 'eighties, we're
dealing with some of the hangover decisions made when they made more sense back in those days.

**** Setting paragraph width (=C-x f=)
There's multiple ways to set the width of paragraphs within a buffer to format later with =M-q=, but
this has to be one of the shortest to get there: simply use =C-x f= and feed it a number. Don't make
it too huge though. If you don't set a number here (or leave it at 0), the default paragraph width
is 70 characters.

**** Reformatting paragraph to width (=M-q=)
Stick your cursor (point) into the paragraph you want to format, hit =M-q=. Done.

**** Setting default width on startup
You can set a default width in your =init.el= file with the fragment:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq fill-column 100)
#+END_SRC

or any other relevant width. This applies when you reformat the paragraph manually, but you can have
emacs do the reformatting for you in the current buffer (=M-x auto-fill-mode=) as you go.

** Dired
Info link: [[info:emacs#Dired][Dired]]

These are some of the commands that can be used in a dired buffer. For all intents, you can do nearly
everything in here that you could do from a commandline—deletion, moving or renaming. Of course, creation
is done by simply opening a new buffer and saving it to a location that you enter when you type
=C-x s=. You can move using the usual cursor motion commands, either Up/Down/Left/Right or C-n/C-p.

With regard to moving by "pages", you can insert the content of subdirectories in each dired buffer with
the command M-x dired-insert-subdir. That content will appear below the content of the top directory, with each
subdirectory that you insert becoming a new page. Use C-x [ and C-x ] to move between those pages.

|----------------------+--------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| *Command*            | *Keys* | *Notes*                                               |
|----------------------+--------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| mark for deletion    | d      | Once you've marked files, use x to delete them all    |
| Delete now           | D      | Will ask for confirmation                             |
| Unmark one entry     | u      | Only unmarks if marked already                        |
| Unmark all entries   | U      | Removes all marks in the dired buffer                 |
| Mark by extension    | *.     | Requests an extension to apply marks with             |
| Kill                 | k      | Remove marked files from listing                      |
| Toggle marks         | t      | Invert whatever marks are present                     |
| Query/replace-regexp | Q      | Asks for regexp to replace, then asks for replacement |
|                      |        | It then proceeds through all matches asking y/n       |
|----------------------+--------+-------------------------------------------------------|

To remove certain files from the listing (this does not delete them from the disk), mark them first with
=u=, then select =k=. You can also remove file patterns by first selecting by regexp as follows: 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x dired-mark-files-regexp <RET> .*\.xml$ <RET>
#+END_SRC
This marks everything that matches the =*.xml= pattern. Then hit =k= to remove the xml files from the listing. 
The same thing can be done (if you wish to remove files with a matching extension) with =*.= as follows:
=*.xml=

You can instead remove all the uninteresting files from your dired listing by using =M-x dired-omit-mode=, then
=M-x dired-omit-expunge= followed by a filepattern to match. For example, let's say you previously ran =% g= in
the dired window (similar to dired-mark-files-regexp but for their contents instead) and got several files marked,
you could then do =M-x dired-omit-expunge= followed by a period to specify all files not already marked. This will
prune all other files from being shown in the listing. They're still there on disk, they just don't show up until
you toggle dired-omit-mode again.

Deletion marks are different from normal marks, in that when you go k, you erase those marked files from disk.
To remove files from the disk, mark them each with =d=, then once you have selected the files, use =k= to remove them.
This cannot be undone, much like on any UNIX/Linux/BSD shell.
** Org Mode

*** Link syntax
Generally, links work well within org mode, and don't quite work so well outside once you
try to export the org document to other formats.  Links look like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
[[URL][Description]]
#+END_SRC
or alternatively simply
#+BEGIN_SRC org
[[URL]]
#+END_SRC
Description (if you provide it) should be short, no more than perhaps five words.
URL is anything supported by the Org internals, this can include:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
+ http links: http://example.com/
+ info links: [[info:org#Top]]
+ internal org-mode links [[magit]]
#+END_SRC

Other link formats are described in Org [[info:org#External links][External links]]

You can generally edit existing links by putting your point somewhere into the link you want to edit, and using =C-c C-l=. This allows you to fiddle with the separate parts of the link if you need to change them for any reason.

*** inline images
+ Inline images in org mode: toggle visibility with C-c C-x C-v
+ Change size of inline org images
  + Don't forget to eval (setq org-image-actual-width nil)
  + with #+ATTR_ORG: :height ... :width ...
*** Turn region into list:        =C-c -=
*** Turn region into headers:     =C-c *=
*** Oddities
    If you turn on—or you have defined in emacs startup—scroll-lock-mode, cursor movement within a
collapsed org-mode document behaves slightly differently. 
** magit
*** Requirements
First, install and enable magit if you haven't already. These following instructions assume that
you've done so, and will also presume you have a working knowledge of common git commands.
If a file you're editing is in a git repo, then =M-x magit= will open up a second
window beside your file, and will show you some categories related to the repo. A shortcut is =C-x g=.

*** Magit buffer commands
From the magit buffer, you can do the following things. Most of them will prompt for other
things if they need them. Usually you put your cursor on the object you want to affect, or
on the section header (usually indicated by a font of different colour) if you wish to affect
all files in that category.

NB: the section header often has a > in the fringe, but this is not visible in textmode.
**** Adding untracked file:        =s= (=M-x magit-stage-file=)
 Simply put your cursor on the file you want to stage, hit s. The file should then shift into "Staged
 changes", ready for you to commit. This roughly duplicates "git add file.blah".

 TODO: No idea how to add a directory from magit yet.
**** Staging changes in an unstaged file:     =s= (=M-x magit-stage-file=)
 Same as above, except for a file that's already part of the git repository.
**** Committing changes in staged files:      =c= (=M-x magit-commit=)
 Will request how you want to commit, hit =c= again to bring up an editor window. Provide a single line
 commit message. If you want to add more lines, leave a blank line after the single line as follows:
 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE diff -n
 Initial commit message

 This is the next line for a multi-line comment.
 # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
 # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
 #
 # On branch master
 # Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
 #
 # Changes to be committed:
 #	modified:   notes.org
 #
 # Untracked files:
 #	notes.org~
 #
 #+END_EXAMPLE
**** Show diff against files:      =d= (diff)

**** Refresh magit buffer:         =g= (magit-refresh)
 This refreshes the magit status buffer once you've made some changes within the project and saved those changes to disk. Installing =magit-filenotify= and enabling =magit-filenotify-mode= in the status window will automate this somewhat.
**** Expand/hide section:          =<TAB>=
 Type TAB to expand or hide the section at point.
**** Visit change/commit:          =<RET>=
 Type RET to visit the change or commit at point.
**** Push changes to remote:       =P u=
This takes any changes you have in your current repo and can push them to a remote repository if you have commit privileges there. I usually like to use =P u= (that's a P followed by a u, not a P-u), but there are other options available.
**** Configure repo variables:     =P C=
This seems to allow you to configure certain things about your current git repository, such as descriptions, further remotes, and some other details.
**** Other movement keys
The usual =n= and =p= keys move the cursor up and down between sections.
*** Wrap up
There's a lot more that I haven't added, perhaps (info "(magit)Top") will help out if you
have magit installed.

** erc (or erc-tls)

EXWM is an X window manager that uses Emacs to control placement of frames or application windows.
This needs to be expanded further, though I haven't had this in operation yet. Here's a snippet 
from IRC log:

[18:51:34]<oni-on-ion> for EXWM, does anyone know how to "unfloat" a window ?

#+END_QUOTE
** vterm
Doesn't come as standard with emacs, but is well worth the install. Running other programs inside vterm
can come with a couple of pitfalls though, especially if you're expecting to run vim, which actually
works, by the way. If you want to copy stuff from a vterm buffer, toggle vterm-copy-mode with C-c C-t,
make your selection, copy it to the killring (or is it yank ring?), then toggle vterm-copy-mode back off
again. Toggling it back off allows commands such as M-w to be passed through to the program you're
running inside vterm—for example, the vim editor.

These are all questions that have turned up in the #Emacs channel, they've had varying responses. In
some cases I've left the discussions mostly unaltered, sometimes I've compacted the conversation to

*** How to search/replace all * at B.O.L. with the same number of #
#+BEGIN_SRC
<laertus> i need some search and replace help...  [19:53]
<laertus> i'd like to replace all the leading *'s in a buffer with the same number of #'s
<laertus> so if a line starts with *** i'd like to replace that part of the line with ###
<laertus> and if it starts with ** i'd like to replace the ** with ## etc
<laertus> i can write a function to do this, but was hoping there'd be an easier way  [19:54]
<Viking667> not really sure. I'd have done it in vim with :%s/***/###/cg  [19:55]
<Viking667> but that's not the emacs way, and that's not taking account of the escaping too.
<laertus> yeah, that'll only work for exactly 3 ***'s and it can be done exactly that way in evil
<laertus> i'm looking for a more general solution that'll work for any number of leading *'s
<dale> laertus: How about: M-x query-replace-regexp RET ^\*+ RET \,(make-string (length (match-string 0)) ?#) RET  [20:08]
<Qudit314159> It works here  [20:13]
<Viking667> I'll have to check that on my buffer.
<laertus> someone gave me a vim solution on #vim:  %s/^\*\+/\=substitute(submatch(0), '*', '#', 'g')  [20:14]
<laertus> unfortunately, i don't think that'll work with evil, as evil doesn't implement vim's regex engine, and instead just uses emacs' regex engine  [20:15]
<Qudit314159> Well, dale's should work. If it doesn't, something else is wrong I'd say
<dale> laertus: Yeah, I tested mine here, it works.  Point was before the text you wanted to replace, right?
<laertus> it's probably something to do with my emacs config  [20:17]
<Viking667> and it works fine for me (I'm pretty much vanilla emacs)
<dale> laertus: I can't think of another way to do it with Emacs regexps.
<laertus> well, thank you, dale, it's a good solution
<dale> You... might be able to do it if you had PCRE and a look-behind assertion, but I'm not sure since I can't remember if PCRE does variable-width look-behind.  [20:19]
<Viking667> i.e. copy query-replace-regexp, paste it into M-x, type in ^\*+, hit RET, copy the last long bit, paste it in etc etc.
<piyo> in elisp: (query-replace-regexp "^\\*+" '(replace-eval-replacement replace-quote (make-string (length (match-string 0)) 35)) nil nil nil nil nil)  [20:23]
<piyo> also, works for me if I turn off pcre-mode and on, as well. yeah  [20:25]
<Viking667> I might snip that and stuff it into my notes.org  [20:26]
<laertus> piyo: that works for me but it prompts me to confirm every replacement  [20:27]
<piyo> press ! to confirm all
<laertus> ah, ok.. thanks  [20:28]
<piyo> press ? for more info in the query-replace-regexp
<laertus> this vim solution:  :g/^\*/norm! vt r#  [20:29]
<piyo> to me, doing that (make-string...) thing in the minibuffer makes me want more guided help.
<laertus> makes me realize that this could be done with a macro
<laertus> just search for a * at the beginning of the line, and then replace all *'s until the first space with #'s  [20:30]
<laertus> and repeat the macro until done
<piyo> the same thing with tramp, can't remember the incantation. Can't you just transient/dialog box the url for me?

*** How to clean up a referred URL from duckduckgo - jamzattack from #emacs@freenode
Duckduckgo does a very sinful thing -- instead of linking to
=https://url.com=, it links to:
: https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%3A%2F%2Furl.com

Here, I define a function that removes all this junk, and use [[info:elisp#Advising Named Functions][advice]]
to filter the arguments given to [[help:shr-urlify][shr-urlify]].  Because this is
relatively low-level, all occurrences of duckduckgo's redirects that
are parsed with =shr= are replaced with the clean version.

#+name: un-duckduckgo-url
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (defun un-duckduckgo-url (args)
    "Cleanse a url from duckduckgo's janky redirect.
  This takes the same args as `shr-urlify', passed as a list."
    (let ((start (nth 0 args))
          (url (nth 1 args))
          (title (nth 2 args)))
      (list start
            (let ((unhexed (url-unhex-string url)))
              (if (string-match "\\`.*[&\\?]uddg=" unhexed)
                  (replace-match "" nil nil unhexed)
                url))

*** How to create a second buffer on the same file with a separate point/mark
#+BEGIN_SRC
[11:41:32]<Viking667> Hi all. Wanted to know if I could have a second buffer on a file with its own point/mark? (Normally if I split the window to make two buffers) I notice that if I move the point in the first buffer, that'll be mirrored in the second buffer. That's not quite what I want.

           each resize, it can take a while on older computers.
[16:53:09]<Viking667> I'm not sure if it's applicable in other places too.
          Nice thing about it is that only the image gets resized, not the buffer text.

*** Turn a file listing from ls (for example, from Ctl-U M-!) into a dired listing
if the buffer content is like the output from ls -l or rpm -qvl , =M-x dired-virtual-mode RET=. I use this for turning linux package listings into
browsable dired buffers. bpalmer from #emacs notes that you may need to (require 'dired-x)  first, as it doesn't seem to set up an autoload.

*** Preserve indentation in org mode source blocks such as =#+BEGIN_SRC=
I had a problem recently where org mode would reindent my source code when I saved it back after
a =C-c '= episode. I'd head off into (org-edit-src-code), make the changes I needed, but afterwards,
org mode just indented my source code back to the nearest relevant header. I believe it might have
removed tabs from the block too. Anyhow, the fix is simple, at least for me. There's a param to add
to the =#+BEGIN_SRC= param, =-i=. It should end up looking a bit like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
,#+BEGIN_SRC c -i
.....
,#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Mastering Emacs
https://www.masteringemacs.org/
    If you think you know Emacs from this little bit I've explained here, then go read this book. It will revolutionise your emacs usage if you read it through and implement some of the things Mickey Petersen talks about. This is one of the few ebooks I've bought, and is reasonably priced for what it is. At the time I write this, it comes in at $49.95 in greenbacks, with the possibility that it may go up in the future.
** Things to find out about
*** org-pdfview and pdftools
Looks like org-pdfview has been replaced by org-pdftools. I had warnings when I loaded that package.
I think pdftools is the debian or fedora package texlive-pdftools.
*** How to remove numbers from headers in HTML/PDF exports
I seem to have run into a bit of a bug when exporting to PDF. I have a TOC header, but no list of
headers in that TOC. Strange thing is, the HTML works and shows a full Contents list. Thankfully
they don't have numbers.
*** Learn more about how to use registers
I already know about save and insert (=C-x r s <x>= and =C-x r i <x>=), but I'm not sure about
other register commands.
* Vim
You know, that other editor. The one that emacs users don't like to admit liking. It has a tighter
focus on editing text. That's it. Nothing more. It's not an eco-system like Emacs is, and doesn't
try to be anything else. However, even it has a scripting language underneath, called vimscript.
Because the editor is focussed so tightly on editing text, it has a wide commandset for editing, and
you can do some really compact and powerful commands in just a few keys.

One example I like to quote so often, because I haven't found an equivalent that's any shorter, or
even the same size. I do this with a good number of lines in a file, definitely more than 14 lines,
but you could tailor it to suit.

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
ma013yy41j14p`a  (15 characters)
#+END_SRC
This does the following:

|--------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| *Keys* | *Description*                                            |
|--------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| ma     | :mark, using the a letter. :help mark for more details.  |
| 0      | step to column 0, the left hand side of the screen.      |
| 13yy   | copy 13 lines to the copy buffer, check :help yank       |
| 41j    | step forward 41 lines                                    |
| 14p    | paste 14 copies of the 13 lines each, giving you a total |
|        | of 182 new lines                                         |
| `a     | Go back to where you were                                |
|--------+----------------------------------------------------------|

And that's just one example. It's only 15 characters long, with quite a kick in its tail. And if you
don't find what you want just in vimscript, it even has a plugin system that rocks. I don't tend to
use them, so I don't include much here about it.

I don't describe more detailed vimscript here, basically because I don't know how to use it myself.
** Movement keys
Moving the cursor around involves a few keys, and depends upon whether you're in command mode or
in insert mode. These initial keys are used in command mode, and move around between characters
and lines. Most of these commands will also take an integer as a prefix, meaning "do this n times".

| End of line       | $     |                | The end of the actual line, not just the screen line (*) |
| Top of file       | gg    |                |                                                          |
| Bottom of file    | G     |                |                                                          |
| Jump to line n    | nG    |                | Simply type integer in, then hit G                       |
|-------------------+-------+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------|

(*) As with Emacs, there's a difference between a file line and a screen line. A file line starts
after the last CR, CR/LF or LF (depending on platform of file) and continues until the next
occurrence of a CR, CR/LF, LF or end of file. A screen line (if the file line is wider than the
screen) is just the width of the screen, whether the line's wrapped or not. So for a 349-character
line, and an 80-character screen, the file line would take up five screen lines on screen, and the
"end-of-line" command goes to the end of the file line.

** Diffing files
Check :help diff
There are two ways to diff files with vimdiff. 
  + First, from commandline: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
     vimdiff firstfile secondfile
#+END_SRC
  + and within vim (side-by-side):
  |-------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+-------------------------------------|
  | *Commands*                    | *Keys*                 | *Long form*                | *Notes*                             |
  |-------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+-------------------------------------|
  | Show two files side by side   | :vert diffs other-file | :vert diffsplit other-file | Quote the filename if it has spaces |
  | Show two files top and bottom | :diffs other-file      | :diffsplit other-file      | Quote the filename if it has spaces |
  |-------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------+-------------------------------------|
  + Within vim, you can also use these commands
  |-------------------------+--------+---------|
  | *Commands*              | *Keys* | *Notes* |
  |-------------------------+--------+---------|
  | jump to next change     | [c     |         |
  | jump to previous change | ]c     |         |
  |-------------------------+--------+---------|

** Copying commands
Check out :help copy
|-----------------------------------------+----------|
| *Command*                               | *Key(s)* |
|-----------------------------------------+----------|
| Copy line                               | yy       |
| Copy multiple lines (6 in this example) | 6yy      |
| Alternative to above                    | 6Y       |
| Alternative to above                    | y6y      |
| Copy word                               | yw       |
| Copy char                               | y<Space> |
| Copy to end of line                     | y$       |
| Copy to beginning of line               | y0       |
| Paste content at cursor location        | p        |
| Paste content above cursor location     | P        |
|-----------------------------------------+----------|

As you can tell, many vim commands take an optional numeric argument, either before in the case
of =6yy= or embedded in the command in the case of =y6y=. In this case at least, they both give
you the same result. At least one opinion holds that you should probably prefer the 6yy form, as
it's simply for n times, repeat x item. A special note about the =y<Space>=, means literally hit
the =y= key, followed by the =Spacebar=. You may often see special notes about keys in <> throughout
the Vim help.

** Window commands
Window commands operate to open/close or move between existing windows. In essence, a vim window is like a emacs buffer, in
that they both hold the contents of a file, but work slightly differently.

This table very quickly summarises what I believe to be the most important commands that apply to windows.
  |------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
  | Commands                           | Keys                           | Variables                                         |
  |------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|

Check :help window for the full details, however a short description for most of these follows:

*** Split window below/right: =:sp= /  =:vsp=
This splits the existing window in half so that you have 
  + a top and bottom half or 
  + a left/right half
Your cursor will then end up in the newly opened window.

When =:splitbelow= is set, your "new" window will be created below your existing window, otherwise it will be created above
your existing window. The same holds for =:splitright= - if that is set, your new window is created to the right of the existing
window, otherwise your new window appears to the left.

*** Switch to direction: =C-w <Down>=/=C-w <Up>=/=C-w <Left>=/=C-w <Right>=
In the event you have more than two windows open, you can cycle easily between them all in any direction using the
Ctl-W <direction> keys, making it easier to navigate than using =C-w C-w= continuously.

*** Swap windows: =C-w C-w=
Best command if you have two windows, split either vertically or horizontally. =C-w C-w= just swaps between the two. Simple.

*** Grow/Shrink: =C-w +=/=C-w -=
This increases/decreases the window height by one, or by more with a numeric prefix.

*** Maximize window vertically - =C-w _=
The maximum size appears to be two less than the vertical room available, and leaves one line of text in each other window plus
the status bar for each window.

** Macro commands
Check :help macro
Key mapping is used to change the meaning of typed keys.  The most common use
is to define a sequence of commands for a function key.  Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC vim
        :map <F2> a<C-R>=strftime("%c")<CR><Esc>
#+END_SRC
This appends the current date and time after the cursor (in <> notation, see :help <> for details).
Picking this apart, you have the command :map. This command takes two (or more) arguments. 
+ First argument is the key to bind, delimited by <>, which you may need to specify. If it's just a straight
  key, such as I, you probably don't need to put that into <>, but you will for things like C-c, F2 and
  anything where the symbol takes more than 1 character to type the whole key definition.
  + NB: you can often hit the key itself after typing :map in which case, vim will turn F2 into <F2>.
  For example, if you want to bind F2 (as in the case above), then you type <F2> as the key.
+ The second argument is what you want to type when you hit F2. In this case, it's generally vim
  commands in command mode. You can bind keys in insert mode, but that comes with a bit more to do.
** Exit commands
Check :help exiting
